                There exists a site called <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.
                It is a series of programming puzzles that are released daily during December.
                The puzzles are designed to be solved in any programming language.
                I have been participating to some degree since 2018.
                I have not always completed the puzzles, but I have always enjoyed the challenge.
                2022 I decided to write about my experience.

                This year we had to ensure the reindeer get a grove.
                The grove has star fruit which provides enough magical energy to deliver the presents.
                We start an expedition to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th.

                <input type="checkbox" id="22-1" class="margin-toggle"/>

                </span>
                The first day the Elves started hiking to the grove.
                They were carrying food with them.
                We had to find the largest basket of calories.
                My first attempt was written in golang.
                It was a pleasure to write.
                I was done in under 10 minutes.
