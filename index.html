                There exists a site called <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.
                It is a series of programming puzzles that are released daily during December.
                The puzzles are designed to be solved in any programming language.
                I have been participating to some degree since 2018.
                I have not always completed the puzzles, but I have always enjoyed the challenge.
                2022 I decided to write about my experience.

            <h2>2022</h2>
            <p>
                This year we had to ensure the reindeer get a grove.
                The grove has star fruit which provides enough magical energy to deliver the presents.
                We start an expedition to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 01</h3>
            <p>
                <label for="22-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="22-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
                <span class="marginnote">
                    <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/01/go">Go solution</a>
                </span>
                The first day the Elves started hiking to the grove.
                They were carrying food with them.
                We had to find the largest basket of calories.
                My solution was written in go and we had to sum the input.
                It was a pleasure to write.
                I was done in under 10 minutes.
                Go is a great language.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 02</h3>
            <p>
                <label for="22-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="22-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
                <span class="marginnote">
                    <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/02/go">Go solution</a><br/>
                    <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">Github copilot</a>
                </span>
                The second day a camp was to set up on the beach. 
                The elves decided to play rock paper scissors to determine who would set up closest to the snacks.
                You get a encrypted strategy guide on how to win.
                Not being familiar with the go, I kept things basic.
                The solution was implemented in under 10 minutes.
                I have copilot to thank for that.
                Reflecting I realise how easy Java lends itself to over engineering.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 03</h3>
            <p>
                <label for="22-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="22-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
                <span class="marginnote">
                    <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/03/go">Go solution</a>
                </span>
                The third day the rucksacks were packed for the jungle journy.
                The challenge was around packing efficiently.
                Using sets made the solution easy to write.
                However, I was lazy and instead of doing the math I just hardcoded ASCII to priority values.
                The second part was an order slower due to copying a slice whereas the first part was done in-place.
                I was not able to do the problem on day 3, so I did it on day 4 together with Day 4's challenge.
                Both were completed together in under 30 min. 
                I have no idea how the top guys finish so fast.
