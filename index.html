                There exists a site called <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.
                It is a series of programming puzzles that are released daily during December.
                The puzzles are designed to be solved in any programming language.
                I have been participating to some degree since 2018.
                I have not always completed the puzzles, but I have always enjoyed the challenge.
                2022 I decided to write about my experience.

            <h2>2022</h2>
            <p>
                This year we had to ensure the reindeer get a grove.
                The grove has star fruit which provides enough magical energy to deliver the presents.
                We start an expedition to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 01</h3>
            <p>
                <label for="22-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="22-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
                <span class="marginnote">
                    <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/01/go">Go solution</a>
                </span>
                The first day the Elves started hiking to the grove.
                They were carrying food with them.
                We had to find the largest basket of calories.
                My first attempt was written in golang.
                It was a pleasure to write.
                I was done in under 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 02</h3>
            <p>
                <label for="22-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="22-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
                <span class="marginnote">
                    <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022/02/go">Go solution</a>
                    <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">Github copilot</a>
                </span>
                The second day a camp was set up on the beach. 
                The elves decided to play rock paper scissors to determine who would set up closest to the snacks.
                You get a encrypted strategy guide on how to win.
                Not being familiar with the language, I kept things basic.
                The solution was implemented in under 10 minutes.
                I have copilot to thank for that.
                Reflecting I realise how easy Java lends itself to over engineering.
